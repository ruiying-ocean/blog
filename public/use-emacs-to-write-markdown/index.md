# Use Emacs to Write Markdown

Writing Markdown under emacs can use markdown-mode to perform convenient operations such as syntax highlighting and preview. Specific commands can be obtained through Emacs wiki or documentation.
However, it is worth mentioning that preview should set the markdown command of emacs to a specific variable, for example, "/usr/bin/pandoc" is to connect pandoc and md files, and then Cc Cc P to preview, the preview is on the web So it should be converted to html through pandoc.

Update: now I use Emacs org-mode to export markdown file, and 
use grip-mode to preview it.
