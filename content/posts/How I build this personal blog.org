* Framekwork
I use =hugo= to build site. As in [[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/][the official documentation]], hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator written in Golang. It converts source markup files (e.g., org, markdown, Rmarkdown, quarto) to html file.

** Structure
config
theme
content
public


** Create new post

** Build site
Hugo render to under =public=

** Depoly remotely
