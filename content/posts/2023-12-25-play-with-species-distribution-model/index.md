I am trying species distribution model recently and generating some nice figure, so I think my blog is a good place to store these pretty things.

## Platform
Most ecologists use R and there is a curated list of packages[^1-2].

## Main Steps
1. Presence-absence data & Environmental Data
2. Fit model (which could use different algorithms)
3. Project model to past/present/future environmental data

## More than data-model-projection
1. Variable selection: remove highly correlated and low-importance variable/feature
2. Data partition: split data into train data (to feed the model); validation data (for model tuning); test data (an independent examination dataset for the result of train+validation). Cross validation is to use different methods (randomly or spatially, or environmentally) to partition the data and fit/evaluate data.
3. Hyper-parameter of model: to tune a range of parameters in each specific model algorithm
4. Model evaluation: use AUC/TSS
4. Ensemble model: train models using different data partition strategies/model algorithms/hyperparameters and pick the best/mean output

## Planktic foraminifera case study

I use core-top data and convert them into presence/absence data. Then I model two species (G. ruber white/G. bulloides) using SST/SSS/NPP/Chl/phytoplankton biomass/ice cover/pH/. This is basically a just-for-fun version of  Waterson et al. (2017) reconstruction[^3]. Here is the results:
