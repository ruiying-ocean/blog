I use =hugo= to build site. As stated in [[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/][the official documentation]], hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator written in Golang.
It converts source markup files (e.g., org, markdown, Rmarkdown, quarto) to html file.

** A skeleton of website

Below is a copy from the hugo documentation.
#+begin_src
my-site/
├── archetypes (templates for new content)
├── assets
├── content (markup files)
├── data (data files (JSON, TOML, YAML, or XML) that augment content, configuration, localization, and navigation)
├── hugo.toml (configuration file)
├── images
├── layouts
├── netlify.toml (netlify configuration)
├── public (generated after building the site)
├── resources
├── static
└── themes (as the name says)
#+end_src

** Build locally
*** Command line
#+begin_src sh
hugo server -D
#+end_src

*** Rstudio + blogdown
I used `blogdown` for a while and I liked it. But I do not favour Rstudio because it is too slow to follow me.

#+begin_src R
  blogdown::new_site()
  blogdown::serve_site() ## build local website
  blogdown::new_post() ## new post, usually pops up a UI
#+end_src

*** Emacs easy-hugo
This is a lightweight but good enough solution. There are also other packages in Emacs like [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]]. But it is not how I work.
