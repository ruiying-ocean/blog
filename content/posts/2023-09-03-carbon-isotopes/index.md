## Basics
Carbon stable isotopes are $^{13}C$, $^{12}C$. But they are more complex than oxygen isotopes.

## Seawater DIC $\delta^{13}C$

Key: organic matter = low $\delta^{13}C$

- Photosynthesis (prefers $^{12}C$, enriching seawater $\delta^{13}C$) & Respiration (release $\delta^{13}C$-deplete carbon)
- Global terrestrial carbon pool (which also increases atmospheric $\delta^{13}C$) & lithosphere input ($\delta^{13}C$-deplete carbon)
- Air-sea equilibrium (lower temperature leads to greater differences, with $\ce{CO2}$ higher than DIC in $\delta^{13}C$. But this process influence more on the atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ because of its much smaller (1/50 times) size of inorganic carbon pool)
- Ocean Mixing (NADW has higher $\delta^{13}C$ from surface Atlantic, AABW has lower value due to more mixing of deep waters)

## Foraminifera test $\delta^{13}C$


The difference between seawater DIC and foraminiferal test is due to abiotic kinetic fractionation and vital effects. Abiotic kinetic fractionation results in a 1% enrichment relative to bicarbonate, and this enrichment is conservative. More variation of offset is from vital effects 

- Symbionts
- Species difference, habitat depth, sesasonal variation


## Conclusion 
Isotopic fractionation is like fliuds with different densities flowing through different reserviors (namely global carbon cycle). Some stay, some go.
