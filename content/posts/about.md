## About
I am a CSC-funded PhD student at [School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/) studying planktic foraminifera, a group of marine zooplankton exsiting in the Earth since mid-Jurassic (160 Ma). Despite focusing on foram, My scientific interests are understanding the fundamental ecological mechanisms. For example, how global changes influence marine plankton ecology/evolution processes and corresponding functions? My main tool is an Earth system model, cGEnIE.
