* Framekwork: Hugo
I use =hugo= to build site. As in [[https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/][the official documentation]], hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator written in Golang.
It converts source markup files (e.g., org, markdown, Rmarkdown, quarto) to html file.

* Configure websites

* Build locally

* Depoly in the cloud
