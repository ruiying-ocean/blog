## Basics
Stable isotopes of oxygen are $^{16}O$, $^{18}O$ (an interesting one is the recently found $^{28}O$, but not sure its life time, Kondo et al. Nature 620, 965â€“970 (2023)). Isotopic fraction of oxygen isotopes happens when their relative abundance changes. Usually it can be decomposed into "ice volume effect" and "temperature effect" (Shackleton et al. 2023, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-023-01250-y).

## Seawater $\delta^{18}O$

- Evaporation - Precipitation (both prefer light isotope) which influence salinity
- Ice volume effect (ice formation select light isotopes)
- Mixing

## Foraminifera test $\delta^{18}O$

Foraminifera incorporate oxygen when build calcite, therefore $\delta^{18}O$ in the calcite reflects the ambient environment with uncertainty $\epsilon$:
$$
\epsilon = \delta^{18}O_{cal} - \delta^{18}O_{sw}
$$
In general, higher temperature makes both atoms vibrates faster, and causing the relative difference between heave and light isotopes smaller. And vice versa, cooler environment has higher  $\delta^{18}O$ .  Generally, it forms a linear model

$$
T = a - b * \epsilon
$$

## Vital effects

- Symbionts
- Size
- carbonate ion concentration ([$\ce{CO3^2-}$]) probabily by influencing calcification rates and thus kinetic fractionation effects
- Species difference, particuarly their habitat depth
