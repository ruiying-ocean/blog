## Important Gateways
1. Drake Passage
2. Tasman Gateway
3. Isthmus of Panama (also known as Central American Seaway)
4. Bering Strait
5. Tethys Sea
6. Indonesian Seaway

## Closing of Tethys Sea (with the collision of India, from 55 Ma to late Miocene)
Tethys Sea provided deep water connections between the major ocean basins.


## Drake Passage (more uncertain)
One of the most important gateway because the opening of Darke Passage is the prerequisite of the formation of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The ACC was proposed to be a key mechanism to cool down the Earth (Kennett, 1977; Berggren and Hollister, 1977) because it is so strong (120 Sv in the modern days) that blocks the meridional heat transport. However, this hypothesis is controversial because (1) strong ACC is not necessarily related to cooling and (2) gateway is not the only crucial factor causing strong ACC, (3) the timing of open Drake Passage is uncertain.

## Tasman Gateway
33.5 ± 1.5 Ma (Scher et al. 2015)



Indonesian Seaway  (still open, less known)

Closure of Isthmus of Panama (3 Ma)
prevents the fresh Pacific water from flowing into Atlantic, stronger AMOC, and more moisture

Opening of Bering Strait (5 Ma, less important)
