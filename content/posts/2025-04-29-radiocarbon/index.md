## Radiocarbon age
calculated based on exponential decay (half-year: 5568 years) and use 1950 as reference year

## Calendar Age

Calibrated radiocarbon age considering the variability of atm 14C/12C. The calibration can be done using calibration curves like IntCal20, Marine20.

## Reservoir Age
Samples are exposed to different source from atmosphere (e.g., ocean) and thus "contaminated". The offset between the reservoir (e.g., ocean) and atmosphere is used as estimate ocean ventilation.

## Ideal Age
Real transit time: time passed since last contact with atmosphere (circulation effect)
